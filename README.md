In many years, I've vritten many "precious" scripts, most in python, but also in bash, to simplify my works.
Normally I use ~/bin as a "depot" for this scripts, but maybe someone else could use them :)

Go to [git master](https://github.com/ZeeD/unusefulscripts) to get them :)

At the moment the scripts are:

`contabatt.py`
- ~~stolen~~ converted from [Massimo Bacilieri](http://groups.google.com/group/it.comp.os.linux.software/msg/8391cf5738b33286),
  it counts how many fingers I 'should have' used to write a text...

`aggiorna\_lista\_movimenti.py`
- A simple script I use to update the historian of my movements on banco posta
  on line (they keep only 4 months!)

`Turing.py`
- Just a little boring [Turing machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
  implementation I wrote in a couple of hours

`drawMRO.py`
- ~~stolen~~ borrowed from [Michele Simionato](http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/python/drawMRO.html),
  it draw the Method Resolution Order (inheritance diagram) using graphviz' dot.

`Numera.py`
- Rename each filename passed as argument, preinserting a number in crescent
  order.
  I find it useful for reordining files

`pszoom.py`
- ~~stolen~~ adapted from [psnup2](http://consodoc.com/psnup2/), it 'zoom' the
  pages on ps documents, removing the space around the text.
  I find it useful while printing articles like booklets

`Rinomina.py`
- Rename each file in a dir, support many features

`SistemaCase.py`
- Rename each file you pass it, using my conventions on casing :)

`SistemaNumeri.py`
- Rename each file you pass it, padding numbers present in each filename

`Tagga.py`
- *OLD* program...
  I used to use it before amarok to automagically tag my music files using file
  names

`Televideo.py`
- Use BeautifulSoup to screen-scrape [www.televideo.rai.it](http://www.televideo.rai.it/televideo/pub/solotesto.jsp?pagina=505)

`trovaRaggruppamenti.py`
- Search for how many combinations "groups" / "pages for group" are necessary to
  print something as a booklet

`Walla.py`
- Recognize and move wallpaper to my walldir

`dot2ps.sh`
- render a graphviz' dot file as a ps

`dot2svg.sh`
- render a graphviz' dot file as a svg

`dotdisplay.sh`

`EstraiData.sh`

`imageMassTag.sh`
- *OLD* *BUGGY* and *NEVER USED*...
  I doesn't know what it does

`prolog.sh`
- I don't know why I needed it, but problably there was a good reason for this
  little shell around pl

`tex2png.sh`
- This is funny :) I ~~stolen~~ borrowed some ideas from KopeTeX.
  Just write a formula in LaTeX and tex2png will generate an image for you
